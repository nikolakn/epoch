However, her contribution to the development of coding and computer languages is not that she invented a device that was the breakthrough of Charles Babbage in the 1820s with his Difference Machine. Instead, Lovelace created the very first machine algorithm in 1843.",

To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent concurrent data races, its \"borrow checker\" tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compilation. Rust borrows ideas from functional programming, including static types, immutability, higher-order functions, and algebraic data types. It is popular for systems programming.",
